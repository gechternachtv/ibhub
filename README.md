## todo:

- get a way to put the frontend source availible in a more organized way (probably git submodules)
- text explanations on inputs
- newsontop illustrations on inputs

- default values on "observe"
- add a way to save selectors for domains on the db so you dont have to keep retyping them

- add support for custom server location, and not always same origin
- add more complex theme support, like theme from js object or external css AND custom css
- add settings page to change themes (?) and custom server location (?)
- about page with github link

- more error handling cases
    - front end no server connection
    - multiple failures on serverside
