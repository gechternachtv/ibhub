The abstractions it uses are zero cost and the Javascript it generates is human readable. It has seamless integration with Javascript. The neatest part? You can compile the Haxe code you wrote in C, Java, or hell even PHP! You have the advantage of only writing the code once for both the front and back end without ever touching NodeJS.>>>/lambda/30385",

I have taught it myself after Go and to me it feels like it allows me to write concurrent code much easier and giving me more control over how I wanna implement it (threads, channels or async). The learning resources also feel like the best I've ever dealt with, there's an official learning book, there's \"Rust by example\", the standard library docs always provide examples too and there's a million more good things I can say about it. Up until now I haven't ran into any significant problems with the language unlike Go (https://fasterthanli.me/articles/i-want-off-mr-golangs-wild-ride) and I think in the future it will entirely replace C++. Has lainon tried Rust yet?                                                ",

Js let's you do some functional shanenigans but sometimes it get's in the way, Also the lack of a real type system leads to a lot of time debugging. I used to like typescript till i tried ReScript (https://rescript-lang.org/try)  a bit. It's type system is far better than typescript BS and the lang itself is clear enough with a neat pack of features. It compiles to JS so i don't get in trouble. So far is a bit rough in the edges but i quite like it. Do someone has a better option or have a similar experience? Let's share                                                ",

      "content": "Most open world games are antithetical to adventure, actual adventures and the stories they inspire tend to have a sense of \"whoops you're fucked now guess you'll have to deal with it for a while now\" to them. For example here are things you would see on an adventure:>getting captured and forced into servitude as a gladiator for days with no obvious means of escape>working off a debt to pirates on a dock and risking having a bounty if you escape without paying in full>being blocked from entering a city due to a quarantine camp being set up outside for infected refugees>getting jailed on suspicions of being a spy crossing borders due to an ongoing war in the region>being invited to perform with a troupe touring towns and drinking and sleeping with them in inns or camps>being stuck in a town/port and having to secure a carriage/boat to your next destination You see none of that in open world games because it would \"take away freedom from the players\" and instead of trying to think of creative designed ways to add freedom like how New Vegas gives you various ways of entering Vegas which was great, they just don't bother with scenarios like these at all. They're good even when they're completely railroaded like having to close the Oblivion gate to enter Kvatch, as long as you're stuck in a certain place with a problem that makes you think \"whew glad that's over\" when it's finished.Most of the time in open world games problems like these would have jarring solutions like letting the player simply kill everyone, or hop over a wall, or pay off everything with their gigantic treasure hoards they carry around everywhere in their pockets and that they gained by selling goblin armor. Open world games are too limited by having to cater to normalfags who hate being restricted or forced to be creative and who want to be demigods who are never inconvenienced, and for that reason they'll never be a true adventure or a world and will feel like a trivial child's playbox.",
